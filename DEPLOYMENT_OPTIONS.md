# M-Kite Kitchen Deployment Options

This document provides an overview of the deployment options we've set up for your M-Kite Kitchen application.

## Option 1: Firebase Deployment (Full-Stack)

**Files to use:**
- `firebase.json`
- `.firebaserc`
- `build-deploy.js`
- `functions.js`
- `server/firebase-production.ts`

**Documentation:**
- `FIREBASE_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `FIREBASE_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md`

**Build and deploy commands:**
```bash
node build-deploy.js
npx firebase deploy
```

**Pros:**
- Single platform for both frontend and backend
- Easy scaling with Firebase services
- Built-in CDN for static assets
- Good free tier for low to medium traffic

**Cons:**
- Need external PostgreSQL database (Firebase doesn't provide PostgreSQL)
- More complex setup for database connection
- Can become expensive with high traffic or data usage

## Option 2: Netlify (Frontend) + External API (Backend)

**Files to use:**
- `netlify.toml`
- `netlify-build.js`
- `netlify/functions/api.js` (optional for simple API functions)

**Documentation:**
- `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

**Build and deploy commands:**
```bash
node netlify-build.js
# Then deploy via Netlify UI or CLI
```

**Pros:**
- Simple deployment process for frontend
- Easy continuous deployment from Git
- Free SSL certificates
- Good free tier for frontend hosting
- Preview deployments for branches

**Cons:**
- Need separate backend hosting
- More configuration for connecting frontend and backend

## Option 3: Render Blueprint (Full-Stack)

**Files provided by Render:**
- `render.yaml`

**Documentation:**
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`

**Pros:**
- One-click deployment of full stack
- Built-in PostgreSQL database
- Simple configuration
- Free tier available for all components

**Cons:**
- Less control over individual components
- May not scale as well for high-traffic applications

## Deployment Decision Guide

### Choose Firebase if:

- You want a single platform for hosting, functions, and other services
- You're comfortable setting up an external PostgreSQL database
- You need additional Firebase services (Authentication, Storage, etc.)
- You want good scalability for medium to large applications

### Choose Netlify + External API if:

- You want the simplest frontend deployment 
- You already have a separate backend API
- You want easy preview deployments
- Your backend needs are simple or you're using Netlify Functions for lightweight APIs

### Choose Render if:

- You want the simplest full-stack deployment
- You need a PostgreSQL database included in your setup
- You prefer a more traditional hosting environment

## Environment Variables

Whichever deployment option you choose, you'll need to set these environment variables:

1. **For the frontend:**
   - `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (if backend is separate)
   - Firebase config variables (if using Firebase services)

2. **For the backend:**
   - `DATABASE_URL` (PostgreSQL connection string)
   - Any API keys or secrets for third-party services

## Next Steps

1. Choose your preferred deployment option
2. Follow the specific deployment guide for that option
3. Set up the necessary environment variables
4. Deploy your application
5. Verify the deployment works as expected
