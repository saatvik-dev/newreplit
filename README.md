- **State Management**: React Query for server state, React Hook Form for forms
- **Deployment**: Configured for deployment on Netlify

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Supabase account (recommended for production) or direct PostgreSQL database
- Application will use in-memory fallback storage when no database connection is available

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:
     ```
     # For direct PostgreSQL connection
     DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/dbname
     
     # For Supabase connection
     VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
     VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
     ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Database Setup

The application supports three storage options:

1. **Supabase** (recommended for production): Set the Supabase environment variables 
2. **Direct PostgreSQL** (alternative): Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
3. **In-memory Storage** (for development): Used automatically as fallback when database tables don't exist

For Supabase setup:
1. Create a Supabase project
2. Set up tables using the SQL in `scripts/create-tables.sql`
3. See [docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md](docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions

For direct PostgreSQL:
```
npm run db:push
```

The deployment includes:
- Static hosting for the React frontend
- Serverless Functions for the backend API
- Integration with Supabase for database storage
- Fallback mechanism for database connectivity issues

When deploying to Netlify, you need to set the following environment variables:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
